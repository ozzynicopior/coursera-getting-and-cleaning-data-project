# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This is a repo created as a required project for the Johns Hopkins `Getting and Cleaning Data` course:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/home/welcome

The project was aimed at demonstrating how data is collected and cleaned, esp. on how to create a so-called "tidy data set" for subsequent analysis. 

The data used in this project is described here: 
`The UCI Machine Learning Repository` (http://bit.ly/1mEvWTG).

# Project Summary

The project asked to create an `R script` called `run_analysis.R` that does the following:

* Merges the `training` and the `test` sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the `measurements` on the `mean` and `standard deviation` for each measurement.
* Uses `descriptive activity names` to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creates a second, independent `tidy data set` with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
